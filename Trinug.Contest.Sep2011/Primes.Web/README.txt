This month’s User Group Code Challenge:


  
The Problem: 
To come up with the most efficient way to find prime numbers 
  
The Challenge: 
Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. So if you start with a problem that divides numbers by itself, then by the number below it, etc – that is the starting place. As the application runs longer, it will take exponentially longer. But there are many efficiencies you can add to significantly reduce the time. 
  
For example, here are two hints:
If the number is divisible by two – then you don’t have to attempt to see if it’s prime, it definitely isn’t.
If the number is divisible by 5 (aside from the number 5) – then you don’t have to attempt it, because it’s definitely not prime.

There will be 2 winners: 
1) whoevers algorithm that correctly finds all the primes between 0 and 100000, the fastest
2) whoever finds the most efficiencies (there are several!) 
  
Hints: 
A) The time-to-beat for 0 to 100000 is 20.0673107(~20 seconds)
B) there are at least 5 efficiencies you can apply (including the two listed above). 
  
The Solution:
Can be written in VB.NET or C#
Should adhere to all proper naming and coding standards from industry best-practices. This includes solution and project names, variable names, etc.
Should be FxCop compliant with no or few FxCop warnings
Should be as simple as possible, ideally leveraging OO instead procedural coding
Should use Unit Testing
Should be reusable without code changes. In other words, not a custom one-off solution, but something that would work for any developer on any application.
The platform: 
Any UI written in .NET – web, windows, command-line, mobile, etc… 
  
What’s in it for me? 
Recognition among your peers and some swag: 
  
We encourage you to be creative and have as much fun doing it, as we will hope to have looking at the results. Contest will be open through September 9th, 2011 with the results announced on September 14th at the next TRINUG main meeting. 
    
Judging: 
Entries will be judged on a scale of 1-10. Items like code comments, error handling, unit testing, FxCop compliance and OOP add additional points to the score. 
  
Privacy notice: 
TRINUG reserves the right to use your name and code in the announcement on the TRINUG website. You will NOT be inundated with feedback. Submitted code and comments will not be shared with anyone outside the judging committee. 
  
Eligibility: 
Anyone outside of the TRINUG board is eligible to participate. 
  
How to submit: 
Please e-mail the source in the zipped format to jamessdixon@gmail with the subject “TRINUG codechallenge”
